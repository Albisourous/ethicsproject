        <h3>Privacy Badger</h3>
        <p>
            Privacy Badger is a browser extension that blocks trackers from following you on the internet and gathering your
            information. The reason this extension is so powerful is because it has the ability to find new trackers, rather than
            solely rely on a list of known trackers to block. This makes this extension much more applicable to you because it can block the
            trackers that you most come in contact with. To find out more click the following link: <a href="https://privacybadger.org/">Privacy Badger</a>
        </p>
        <h3>Ghostery</h3>
        <p>
            Ghostery is a browser extension that removes ads from websites and blocks trackers. These trackers track the websites
            you visit and use that information to create targeted ads for you. This extension protects you from invasive trackers.
            This also has the added bonus of speeding up websites because more of your internet resources are being used to load the
            content of the page rather than render ads or track your internet movements. To find out more click the following link:

        <h3>HTTPS Everywhere</h3>
        <p>
            HTTPS Everywhere is a browser extension that automatically encrypts your visits to many major websites.
            Without this extension, visits to most websites would default to unencrypted HTTP. This extension changes
            the default by making encrypted requests over HTTPS to websites, thus protecting your privacy. To find out more

        <h3>Password Managers</h3>
        <p>
            Password managers are tools that you can use to prevent unauthorized entry into your online accounts. Many internet users use the same password
            across numerous websites. This can lead to problems because if any one of those websites gets hacked and the hacker obtains your password, the
            rest of your online accounts are also vulnerable. Password managers essentially eliminate this threat because they randomly generate a unique
            password for every online account you set up. These passwords can be accessed with a master password that you create. Despite the small inconvenience,
            password managers are one of the easiest and most helpful tools out there that you can use to protect yourself online. To find out more, click the
